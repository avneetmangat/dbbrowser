The file format for storing connection info has changed.  Connection info is stored in XML format.
The old binary format for connection info is no longer supported.

Please download JDBC driver jar file for your DBMS from your vendors site
and store them on your local machine.

DBBrowser will ask you for the location of JDBC driver jar file when you set up a new connection.

If you change the location of your JDBC driver jar file after setting up a connection,
you will need to edit the connection information for the connection to connect.
This can be done via the UI.
