<p align="center"><img src="../images/set preferences window screenshot.jpg" alt="Set preferences window screenshot" height="240" width="320"/></p>

<br>

The options are:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Records per page - This shows the number of records retrieved while browsing the contents of the database.  Having a page size gives better performance as only the first few records of the table are retrieved.  The records retrieved are sorted by primary key(s) and returned.  If there are no primary keys in the table, the records are sorted by the first column (first as in first column returned by the DBMS).  Default is 100</li>
    <li>Auto Commit - check the box to set auto commit on.  Default is on.</li>
    <li>Show SQL Log - If this is checked, a new Window opens which shows every SQL statement being sent to the DBMS</li>
</ul>
